# DevProject

## Overview

I'm building a website for the 'Create Your First Local HTML/CSS Project' section of Codecademy's 'Developing Websites Locally' module. I used ChatGPT to come up with some content to put in this website.

## Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS

## Resources used

- Google fonts
- images from Unsplash

## Notes

At this time, I am trying to fix the issues that I can see, like:

- my hero image is not showing
- The stories of kindness aren't all on the same level
